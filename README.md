# COVID-19-Precaution-with-face-mask-detection
• Implemented deep learning algorithms (ConvNet) to devolop a face mask classifier in Python.
• Visualized training and validation loss and accuracy using Matplotlib.
• Used OpenCV pretrained human face classifier model to detect human faces on the video streams and the face mask detection model was deployed for mask detection on human faces.
• Tools: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV
