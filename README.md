# COVID-19-Precaution- Face Mask Detection
During the pandemic, the wearing the facemask is one of the most important precaution measures.
This project developed a face mask detector with CovNet training and 
1. Implemented deep learning algorithms (ConvNet) to devolop a face mask classifier in Python.
2. Visualized training and validation loss and accuracy using Matplotlib.
3. Used OpenCV pretrained human face classifier model to detect human faces on the video streams and the face mask detection model was deployed for mask detection on human faces.
