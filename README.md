# COVID-19-Precaution- Face Mask Detection
## Description:
During the pandemic, the wearing the facemask is one of the most important precaution measures.
A face mask detector through CovNet training was developed and tested with images and further employed in viedeo streams.
1. Implemented deep learning algorithms (ConvNet) to devolop a face mask classifier in Python.
2. Visualized training and validation loss and accuracy using Matplotlib.
3. Used [OpenCV pretrained human face classifier model](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/db/d28/tutorial_cascade_classifier.html) to detect human faces on the video streams and the face mask detection model was deployed for mask detection on human faces.
4. Technologies : Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Numpy, OpenCV
